# ESP32-S3-GEEK

A repository building on, and improving, Waveshare's MicroPython code source for the [ESP32-S3-GEEK](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-GEEK). They have [sample code](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-GEEK#Demo) for Arduino an MicroPython.

I am working on porting some of the Arduino code for the LCD, which is quite advanced, back to MP, including fonts.
